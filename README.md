# Simple Swift Snippets For Xcode

## How to import all code snippets to Xcode
All Xcode code snippets exist as a `.plist` files in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`
You can simply copy all code snippets (`.codesnippet`) into this folder, restart Xcode and you should have all of them ready to use.

Note: Create the folder if it doesn't exist already. It is created by Xcode when user adds his first custom snippet.

## Usage
I named all completion shortcuts to `s...`. for example, you can input 'slabel' to create UILabel code snippets.

### Placeholder tokens
If you want to add this nice placeholder in rounded blue rect simply put it between `<#` and `#>` and it will be transformed in both editor and final snippet.
